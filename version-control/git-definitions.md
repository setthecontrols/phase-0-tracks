# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Version control is a code version tracking and restoration system.    Why is it useful?  it allows you to maintain all versions of code created up to a commit/version of that code and to resotreup to any commit/version made to the code.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?  Branches are like work spaces that allow a team to experiment with features and test them with a main or master branch of code before committing to features being worked out.    
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?  a commit saves changes to code, serves as a restoration point and a point after which code cane be merged.   A good commit message includes short, but substantive descriptions about the changes in the commit.
* What is a merge conflict?  a merge conflict occurs when branches being merged have commits that are different.
