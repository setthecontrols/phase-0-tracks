## learning plan for jQuery:  
	##  read up on basics on a wiki
	##  "read ahead" by looking at some jQuery projects on github to get an idea of what it looks like.  this seems to help me.
	##  find cheat sheat that makes sense to me
	##  find a biginners exercise course and pick some that look interesting
	##  find videos of people explaining things that are stumping me
	##  if i'm not already working along with exercices, work through some at then end of learning a new thing
	##  take a 10 minute break after 60 minutes.  I've found that breaks is pretty important.  i do better than when i have 
		##  worked continuously to try and finish something that i've been working on for a very long time.  my brain just 
		##  gets stuck after a while and does me no good to keep trying.
